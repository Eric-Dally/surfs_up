# surfs_up
Surfâ€™s up! In this module, I performed data analysis and data exploration on a weather dataset from the island of Oahu to determine if opening a surf shop is worth it. To do this, I performed data analysis and data exploration using Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. 

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to explore Temperature data for the months of June and December to see if opening a surf shop is worth it. 

## Results:

#### Key Differences:

* December recorded slightly lower temperatures with an average temperature of 71 degrees fahrenheit.
* The temperature was very similar for June and Decemeber

## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)

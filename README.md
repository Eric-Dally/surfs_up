Surfâ€™s up! In this module, I performed data analysis and data exploration on a weather dataset from the island of Oahu to determine if opening a surf shop is worth it. To do this, I performed data analysis and data exploration using Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask.

The purpose of the analysis was to explor weather data for the months of June and December. 

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)

# surfs_up
Surf’s up! In this module, I performed data analysis and data exploration on a weather dataset from the island of Oahu to determine if opening a surf shop is worth it. To do this, I performed data analysis and data exploration using Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. 

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to explore Temperature data for the months of June and December to see if opening a surf shop is worth it. 

## Results:

### June Temperature Statistics:

### December Temperature Statistics:

#### Key Differences:

* June recorded hotter temperatures with an average temperature of 75 degrees fahrenheit.
* December recorded slightly lower temperatures with an average temperature of 71 degrees fahrenheit.
* The temperature was very similar for June and Decemeber

## Summary:

My analyse suggests that the island of Oahu has steady weather conditions year round showing similar temperatures in both the summer and winter. However, the only metric used to support this finding was temperature. To further investigate the island's weather conditions, I would run queries on temperature and humidity in the future. This would provide more support on this claim. Overall, I would say the weather is promising to open up a surf shop in this location.
